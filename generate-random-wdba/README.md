# Random wDBA Generation Scripts

This folder contains scripts to generate and validate random weak deterministic BÃ¼chi automata (wDBA) samples. These scripts were used to generate the set of random wDBAs used in our experiments.

## Scripts

### `wdba-gen.sh`
- Generates wDBA samples of different sizes.
- Creates output directories under:
  - `wdba/SizeXX` for the generated automata.
  - `info/SizeXX` for logs of generation and validation.
- Calls `wdba-gen.py` to generate each sample.
- Validates samples using the ROLL library via `ROLL.jar`.
- Moves valid samples to the appropriate folder based on size.
- Logs generation and validation details in the corresponding `info` folder.


## How to Run

1. Make sure `ROLL.jar` is accessible in the parent directory.  
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed for `wdba-gen.py`.  
3. Run the generator script for new samples:

## Generating Random wDBAs

1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x wdba-gen.sh

2. Run the script:

```bash
bash wdba-gen.sh
